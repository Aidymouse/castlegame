// Collision code returns the shortest distance in direction of ray the object would need to move backwards in order to be touching the edge of the object.
// Speed this frame can be modified by that amount, and theoretically the object will never actually end up inside the object.

// Platforms can then be lines

// Make a polygon out of the movement of a shape
// Find points that intersect with this polygon
//

// Motion line is the movement
